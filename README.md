This project uses Selenium WebDriver to scrape trending topics from the X (formerly Twitter) website and stores them in a MongoDB database. It also provides an API server to fetch the scraped trends from the database and display them in a React frontend.

The project demonstrates the integration of backend automation (with Selenium), a database for persistence (MongoDB), and a frontend to showcase the results.
